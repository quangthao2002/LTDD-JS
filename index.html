    // Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

// data 1

    var heightJoin = 1.88;
    
    var BMI_Join = weightJoin/heightJoin **2;    
    
    var markHigherBMI = BMI_Mark > BMI_Join;

    // console.log("Data 1");
    // console.log("BMI Mark: " + BMI_Mark);
    // console.log("BMI Join: " + BMI_Join);
    // console.log("Mark has a higher BMI than Join: " + markHigherBMI);

// data2
    var weightMark = 95;
    var heightMark = 1.88;

    var BMI_Mark = weightMark/heightMark **2;
    
    var weightJoin = 85;
    var heightJoin = 1.76;
    
    var BMI_Join = weightJoin/heightJoin **2;    
    
    var markHigherBMI = BMI_Mark > BMI_Join;
    // console.log(" ");
    // console.log("Data 2");
    // console.log("BMI Mark: " + BMI_Mark);
    // console.log("BMI Join: " + BMI_Join);
    // console.log("Mark has a higher BMI than Join: " + markHigherBMI);

        Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
